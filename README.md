# My System Configuration

Clone this repo to a location of your choice, I keep it in `$HOME` and will
refer to it as `<ii-config>`, but you'll have to substitute the absolute path by
hand.

In `/etc/nixos/`, the following contents are expected:

* `hardware-configuration.nix`: generated by `nixos-generate-config`

* `software-configuration.nix`:
  ```
  { config, pkgs, ... }:

  import <ii-config> {
    inherit config;
    inherit pkgs;
    hostConfig = {
      hostName = ...; # for instance, "thinkpad-x240"
      userName = ...; # for instance, "int-index"
      fullName = ...; # for instance, "Vladislav Zavialov"
      timeZone = ...; # for instance, "Europe/Moscow"
      pwdHash = ...; # the output of 'mkpasswd -m sha-512'
      vboxEnabled = ...; # 'true' for VirtualBox hosts
    };
  }
  ```

* `configuration.nix`:
  ```
  { config, pkgs, ... }:

  {
    imports =
      [
        ./hardware-configuration.nix
        ./software-configuration.nix
      ];
  }
  ```

* `nixpkgs/`: a local checkout of nixpkgs unstable. See ("NixOS with a local
  nixpkgs checkout instead of channels")(nixpkgs-local-checkout).
